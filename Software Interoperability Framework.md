## Introduction

The Strathmore University software ecosystem is a complex and ever-evolving environment. It consists of a wide variety of software applications, from student information systems to research databases. These applications are used by students, faculty, staff, and administrators to support a wide range of activities, from teaching and learning to research and administration.

The interoperability of these software applications is essential for the smooth functioning of the university. Without interoperability, it would be difficult or impossible for users to access and use the information and services that they need.

This interoperability framework is designed to help the university improve the interoperability of its software. The framework provides a set of guidelines and standards that can be used to ensure that software applications can communicate and exchange data with each other.

## Background

The Strathmore University software ecosystem is made up of a wide variety of software applications, including:
- Student information systems
- Research databases
- Learning management systems
- Financial systems
- Human resources systems
- Administrative systems

These applications are used by students, faculty, staff, and administrators to support a wide range of activities, from teaching and learning to research and administration.

The interoperability of these software applications is essential for the smooth functioning of the university. Without interoperability, it would be difficult or impossible for users to access and use the information and services that they need.

For example, if the student information system is not interoperable with the learning management system, it would be difficult for students to register for classes or access their grades. Similarly, if the research databases are not interoperable with the financial systems, it would be difficult for researchers to track the costs of their projects.


## Requirements

The interoperability framework will focus on Semantic and Cross-domain Interoperability:
- Systems will adhere to the common Data Formats and Communication Protocols used within the ecosystem
- It will guide systems to adhere to legal, political and social standards of their operational jurisdictions
- It will be flexible enough to accommodate the wide variety of software applications that are used at the university.
- Likewise, it will be easy to implement and maintain.
- It will be cost-effective.

### Architecture

The interoperability framework is based on a set of standards and guidelines. These standards and guidelines define how software applications should communicate and exchange data with each other.
- Open Group Interoperability Framework

The framework is also based on a set of tools and technologies. These tools and technologies can be used to implement and maintain the interoperability framework.
- Post facto Interoperability

### Implementation

The interoperability framework can be implemented in a number of ways.

One approach is to use a software development methodology that focuses on interoperability. This methodology can be used to ensure that new software applications are developed in a way that is interoperable with existing applications.

Another approach is to use a tool or technology that can be used to integrate existing software applications. This approach can be used to improve the interoperability of existing applications without having to rewrite them.

Our project, will use the software development methodology to ensure interoperability is engrained in the design process of software in the Strathmore University Ecosystem.

## Testing

The interoperability framework will be tested to ensure that it meets the requirements of the university. The testing should be conducted by a team of qualified professionals who have experience in interoperability testing.

The testing should include the following:

- Functional testing: This will be done to ensure that the framework can be used to communicate and exchange data between software applications.
- Performance testing: This will ensure that the framework can handle the volume of data that is expected to be exchanged between software applications.
- Security testing: This ensures that the framework is secure and that data is protected from unauthorized access.

## Operation and Maintainance

The interoperability framework must be operated and maintained to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the university. The operation and maintenance of the framework should be performed by a team of qualified professionals who have experience in interoperability.

The operation and maintenance of the framework should include the following:
- Monitoring: The framework should be monitored to ensure that it is operating as expected.
- Troubleshooting: Any problems that are found should be troubleshot and resolved promptly.
- Updates: The framework should be updated regularly to ensure that it meets the latest standards and guidelines.

## Glossary

- Interoperability: The ability of two or more software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other.
- Standard: A document that defines a set of requirements that must be met by software applications.
- Guideline: A document that provides recommendations for how software applications should be developed or implemented.
- Tool: A software application that can be used to implement or maintain the interoperability framework.
- Technology: A hardware or software solution that can be used to improve the interoperability of software applications.
